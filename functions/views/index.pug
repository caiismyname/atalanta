        h1 FAQ 
        p <b>How does Splitz figure out what my workout was?</b>
        p It uses laps in your activity, how far and fast you ran, and some clever guesswork 🪄. It can detect most types of workouts including intervals and repeats, fartleks, and mixed-distance work.
        br
        p <b>What if I use auto-lap, or a pre-programmed workout on my watch?</b>
        p As long as you also have lap markers when each rep starts and stops, it can figure it out — you can leave auto-lap on! Programmed workouts work great with Splitz as well (we actually prefer it 😉).
        br
        p <b>What if I recorded my warmup and cooldown in the activity as well?</b>
        p That's totally fine, and in fact encouraged! It makes it easier to detect workouts, and saves your followers from a wall of posts 😉
        br
        p <b>Why didn't it update one of my workouts?</b>
        p Sometimes the workout detection gets it wrong. I'm sorry when it does, and I'm working to improve it! 🚀
        br
        p <b>Can it also show my rest?</b>
        p Not yet, but I'm working on it!👷
        br
        p <b>Can I add my own notes?</b>
        p Go for it ✏️! Splitz won't do anything besides create the initial summary for you.
        br
        p <b>Do you collect any personal data?</b>
        p Not at all 🙅‍♂️. Your activity info is parsed, then discarded.
        br
        p <b>Why do I need an account on here?</b>
        p Boring technical reasons 💻. See above though, none of your personal data is collected or stored, and you can delete your account anytime.
        br
        p <b>Who made this? Why?</b>
        p Splitz is made by 
          a(href="https://davidcai.me") David Cai 👋.
          | I got tired of manually updating my workouts with splits and built this instead. I hope you find it useful as well!
