                <h1>FAQ </h1>
                <p><b>How does Splitz figure out what my workout was?</b></p>
                <p>It uses laps in your activity, how far and fast you ran, and some clever guesswork 🪄. It can detect most types of workouts including intervals and repeats, fartleks, and mixed-distance work.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>What if I use auto-lap, or a pre-programmed workout on my watch?</b></p>
                <p>As long as you also have lap markers when each rep starts and stops, it can figure it out — you can leave auto-lap on! Programmed workouts work great with Splitz as well (we actually prefer it 😉).</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>What if I recorded my warmup and cooldown in the activity as well?</b></p>
                <p>That's totally fine, and in fact encouraged! It makes it easier to detect workouts, and saves your followers from a wall of posts 😉</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Why didn't it update one of my workouts?</b></p>
                <p>Sometimes the workout detection gets it wrong. I'm sorry when it does, and I'm working to improve it! 🚀</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Can it also show my rest?</b></p>
                <p>Not yet, but I'm working on it!👷</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Can I add my own notes?</b></p>
                <p>Go for it ✏️! Splitz won't do anything besides create the initial summary for you.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Do you collect any personal data?</b></p>
                <p>Not at all 🙅‍♂️. Your activity info is parsed, then discarded.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Why do I need an account on here?</b></p>
                <p>Boring technical reasons 💻. See above though, none of your personal data is collected or stored, and you can delete your account anytime.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Who made this? Why?</b></p>
                <p>Splitz is made by <a href="https://davidcai.me">David Cai 👋.</a> I got tired of manually updating my workouts with splits and built this instead. I hope you find it useful as well!</p>
